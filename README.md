# Simon-game-challenge
It’s a memory game from the 80’s. You can read about it here: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)/".  I took the starting files (the HTML structure &amp; the CSS layout) from Angela Yu’s Web Development course resources. Here: "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/".  Only the Javascript code is mine. Pubished at: "https://pankajtemp.github.io/Simon-game-challenge/".
